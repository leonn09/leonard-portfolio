This project uses `fetch()` to load JSON, which wonâ€™t work by simply double-clicking `index.html`.  
You need to run a local server:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leonn09/leonard-portfolio.git
   cd leonard-portfolio

2. Start a local server:
    VS Code Live Server: Right-click index.html â†’ Open with Live Server
